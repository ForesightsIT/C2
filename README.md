##### 1st MLSecOps [Microsoft Azure Nanodegree ML Engineer] Operationalization Project (ND00333-AZMLND-C2)


## Project Overview

This is a Machine Learning 'operationalization' project, part of the ML Engineer for Microsoft Azure Nanodegree Program [ND00333-AZMLND-C2] from Udacit (in order to prepare for Microsoft [Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure] Exam DP-100).

The business goal is inferencing foresights for a binary classification of the Bank [Direct] Marketing dataset [predicting if the product (term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed]; by using Azure AutoML to train an ML model before its best model's OpenAPI endpoint gets deployed for production-ready consumption; showcasing the know-how by determining deployments targets, enabling foresights, baselining performance metrics, scaning logs and  benchmarking.


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 


## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 


## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:


## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
