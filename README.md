##### 1st MLSecOps [Microsoft Azure Nanodegree ML Engineer] Operationalization Project (ND00333-AZMLND-C2)


## Project Overview

This is a Machine Learning 'operationalization' project, part of the ML Engineer for Microsoft Azure Nanodegree Program [ND00333-AZMLND-C2] from Udacit (in order to prepare for Microsoft [Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure] Exam DP-100).

Though showcasing the know-how by determining deployments targets, enabling foresights, baselining performance metrics, scaning logs and benchmarking; the business goal was inferencing foresights for a binary classification of the Bank [Direct] Marketing dataset [predicting if the product (term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed]; by using Azure AutoML to train an ML model before its best model's OpenAPI endpoint gets deployed for production-ready consumption by the other ecosystem microservices (including azure automation and/or logic apps) for optimal 'Decision Intelligence MLSecOps' synergy.


## Architectural Diagram

Below is a formal visualization of the key steps diagram related to the completed project, along with its overall end-to-end workflow's critical stages and/or various main steps (as listed below):

- Using Automated ML to determine the best model.


## Areas of Improvement

Potential future improvements could be identified as:

- Retraining Hyperparameter Tuning with HyperDrive using Bayesian and/or 'Entire Grid' sampling, and AUC as the primary metric (rather than accuracy).

- Extending AutoML config to include more parameters.

- Documenting XAI and [operationalizing] model [explanation] as a web service, using the [interpretability package] to explain ML models & predictions.

- Exporting Models with ONNX to be deployed to a DLT connected Dapp device.

- Integrating App Insights with Sentinel and/or CASB.


## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 


## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:


## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
